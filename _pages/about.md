# Full-time research assistant @ Georgia Tech

I am currently a Research Assistant @ [Georgia Tech](https://ece.gatech.edu/) where I am working with Prof. [Matthew T. Flavin](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Matthew-Flavin-2) on artificial intelligence (AI) assisted glasses, haptics interfaces, machine vision, unmanned aerial vehicle, virtual reality (VR), etc. With an interdisciplinary background, my research insterests include flexible electronics, human-computer interaction (HCI), wearable devices, and applied machine learning.

# Undergraduate research assistant @ Wuhan University

Previously, I finished my undergraduate courses @ [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/) in two years and a half while obtaining research experiences and comptetition awards. My B.S. is expected to be received in June 2026. Details are as follows:

Robotics: Under the guidance of Prof. [Xiaohui Xiao](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xiaohui_Xiao) and Prof. [Zhao Feng](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhao-Feng-3), I conducted research with Machine Vision, ROS2 concerning robotics navigation and manipulation.

Mechanics: Under the guidance of Prof. [Yang Li](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yang-Li-281), I worked on reconfigurable linkages and kirigami. Cooperating with Dr. [Tong Zhou](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tong-Zhou-13) and Dr. [Lin Ai](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lin-Ai-7). My collaboration with Dr. Zhou is in revision at Science Advances currently.

Polymers & Flexible Electronics: Under the guidance of Prof. [Kang Liu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Liu-Kang-8), I worked on polymer network, especially hydrogel, and microfliudics. Collaborating with Dr. [Xifan Fu](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Xifan-Fu-2211157401), I published my first co-first author paper about hydrogel e-skin on IEEE Sensors Jounrnal.

HCI: Under the guidance of Prof. [Jun Huang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jun-Huang-6), I engineered a safe voltage driven electro-osmotic haptic actuator and a VR demo. This co-first author paper is submitted.

Interdisciplinary Collaborations: I was the administrator of a WITec alpha300 series confocal Raman microscope at Wuhan Univeristy. I participated in investigating molecular transitions during electrode reactions with Dr. [Liangyuan Chen](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Liangyuan-Chen-2259226898) and the hydration of hydrogel under varying humidities with Dr. [Zehua Yu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zehua-Yu-6). My analysis of electrode reaction of stable zinc-metal batteries led to my co-authorship in Advanced Functional Materials.
